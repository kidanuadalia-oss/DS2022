- Hobbies: Competitive chess, urban exploration, learning dead languages, collecting vintage spy novels
- Spyname: "The Phantom"
- About me (Fake): I'm a 23-year-old linguistics major who moonlights as a professional escape room designer. I speak 7 languages fluently and have an uncanny ability to remember every detail of conversations from weeks ago. My dream is to open a bookstore that doubles as a secret meeting place for international diplomats. I once solved a Rubik's cube blindfolded while reciting Shakespeare backwards.
