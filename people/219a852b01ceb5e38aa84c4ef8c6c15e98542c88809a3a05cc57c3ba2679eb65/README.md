- Hobbies: Data analysis, hiking, and solving complex puzzles
- Spyname: The Data Whisperer
- About me (Fake): I'm a master of disguise who specializes in infiltrating data systems and extracting valuable intelligence. By day, I appear to be a regular student, but by night I use my coding skills to uncover hidden patterns in datasets that could change the world. My cover story is perfect - who would suspect a data science student of being a secret agent?
